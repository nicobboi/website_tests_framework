# Tool implementation guide

**use_tool** is the main script which is called to run a test.

For now, there are five category of test implemented:
  - *Accessibility*;
  - *Performance*;
  - *Security*;
  - *SEO*;
  - *Validation*.

Each category has its folder, which contains all the tests source code and output handlers for that category.

To implement a tool for a category you have to follow this steps:
  - Select the right category folder for your tool;
  - Add all the source code, needed to generate/retrieve the data you want, in a folder;
  - Add in the same folder a file named '*output_handler.py*';
  - Write a function called '*get_output*': it will handle the output generated by your tool and it must have as **_input_** a URL and as **_output_** a dict as following:
    ```
    {
      "scores": {
        "*score_name*": *score_value (int)*,
        ... (you can add all scores you want)
      },
      "notes": *Notes you may want to add about the run (string)*,
      "start_test_timestamp": *string datetime of test starting time (str(datetime) UTC!)*,
      "end_test_timestamp": *string datetime of test ending time (str(datetime) UTC!)*,
      "json_report": *all json data generated by your tool (dict)*
    }
    ```
  - Open the category output handler inside the folder (*categoryname*test.py);
  - Import the *output_handler* created, then assign to *output*['*toolname*'] the return value of the *get_output* function.
